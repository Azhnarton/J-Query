J-Query
=======
The goal of this project is to make an easy to understand explanation of basic to intermediate JQuery
for beginners, with excersises which help them to understand the way it al works.
We try to keep things as simple as possible and don't explain unnecessary stuff you may never need.
The team of developers making this project includes people who are learning JQuery right now and so they
are at the same level as the target audience. This way we hope to give a better explanation than other sources.
